# Feature Context Hub — User Guide

**Feature Context Hub** is a personal workspace for product designers to track every in-flight feature in one place. It replaces scattered Confluence notes, Slack threads, and browser bookmarks with a single file that keeps context, research, calls, and tasks together — organized per feature, always accessible offline.

---

## How to Open the App

Feature Hub has no server — you open it directly in your browser. There are two ways:

**Option A — GitHub Pages (recommended)**

Open this URL in your browser:

**https://elainezhang86.github.io/feature-hub/**

**Option B — Local file**

Double-click `index.html` or run:

```bash
open index.html
```

Both options work. Data saves automatically to your browser's localStorage for that origin — so data entered on GitHub Pages stays on GitHub Pages, and data entered via the local file stays with the local file. Pick one and stick with it.

> **Note:** If you clear your browser data or switch to a different browser or machine, your data will not carry over. There is no server or git sync in this version.

## Navigation

The left sidebar lists every feature with its current status badge. Click any feature to open it. At the top is **Schedule Overview**, a dashboard showing all features at once.

### Sidebar footer

| Icon | Action |
|------|--------|
| Sun/Moon | Toggle light / dark theme |

---

## Schedule Overview

The landing page. Shows every feature as a card with:

- **Status badge** (Discovery / Design / Dev / QA / Done)
- **Customer** and **due date**
- **Current Focus** — what you are actively working on right now
- **Progress bar** — percentage of To Do tasks marked Done (postponed tasks excluded)

Click any card to jump to that feature's detail page.

---

## Adding a New Feature

Click the **+** button next to "Features" in the sidebar. Fill in:

- Title, icon, status, customer, due date
- Summary, current focus
- Team members

---

## Feature Detail Page

Each feature has a header with an editable **status dropdown** and **due date picker**, then a **Current Focus ribbon** you can update at any time.

Below that are tabs, each covering a different dimension of the feature.

## Tabs

### Context

A reference card showing the core feature brief:
- **Summary** — one-paragraph problem statement
- **Key Decisions** — confirmed design/product decisions
- **Constraints** — known limitations and out-of-scope items
- **Links** — Jira tickets, PRDs, Gong calls, design files
- **Team** — PM, Eng, stakeholders with their roles

---

### Domain Knowledge

A personal notebook for context you have built up over time — edge cases, mental models, integration quirks, anything not in the PRD.

- Click **+ Add** to create a new entry
- Entries are collapsible, editable, and deletable
- Title autosaves when you click away

---

### Feature Brief

Structured background context — architecture decisions, data models, domain deep-dives.

- Click **+ Add** to create a new entry
- Same collapsible/editable/deletable pattern as Domain Knowledge

---

### Calls

Log all calls related to a feature — customer discovery, internal syncs, design reviews.

#### Creating a call

Click **+ Add** and choose **Customer Call** or **Internal Call**. The call opens immediately in edit mode — no modal or popup. Fill in the fields directly:

- **Call Name** — primary identifier
- **Type** — Customer or Internal
- **Category** — Customer Discovery, Design Review, Internal Sync, etc.
- **Status** — Scheduled / Completed / Action Items Pending
- **Date**, **Customer**, **Attendees**, **Notes Link**
- **External Resources** — attach slides, recordings, or docs with a label and URL

Click the **edit icon** (pencil) on any existing call card to switch it to edit mode.

#### Call status chips

| Status | Color |
|--------|-------|
| Scheduled | Blue |
| Completed | Green |
| Action Items Pending | Yellow |

#### Inside each call — three tabs

**General Info** — call details, attendees, resources

**Call Prep** — structured pre-call preparation:
- Research Questions, Interviewee Background, Warm-up Questions, Topic Questions, Look For / Listen For
- Use **Copy prep prompt to Claude.ai** to generate AI-assisted prep

**Post Meeting** — paste the transcript; generate an AI summary with Claude

## Tips

- **Delete the sample feature** and add your own once you are comfortable with the layout
- **Use Current Focus as a daily intent** — one sentence: what specifically needs to happen today on this feature
- **Log calls even before they happen** — create the call as Scheduled, fill in prep, paste the transcript after
- **Domain Knowledge is for things you learned, not things you were told** — if you had to figure it out, write it down so you never have to again
- **Postpone, don't delete** — if a task is blocked, postpone it with a reason so the context is preserved
